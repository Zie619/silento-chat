# Fix Xcode Project References

## The Issue
Xcode is looking for Swift files that were moved to the Views/ folder. We need to update the project references.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Open Xcode
```bash
open Silento.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Remove Red File References
In the Xcode Project Navigator (left sidebar), you'll see several files in RED indicating they can't be found:
- LoadingView.swift
- ContentView.swift
- ChatService.swift
- ChatRoomView.swift  
- RoomInfoView.swift
- CreateRoomView.swift
- JoinRoomView.swift
- HomeView.swift
- ParticleBackgroundView.swift

**For each red file:**
1. Right-click on the red file name
2. Select "Delete" 
3. Choose "Remove Reference" (NOT "Move to Trash")

### 3. Add Files from Views Folder
1. Right-click on the "Silento" folder in Project Navigator
2. Select "Add Files to 'Silento'"
3. Navigate to the `Silento/Views/` folder
4. Select ALL Swift files in the Views folder:
   - ChatRoomView.swift
   - ChatService.swift
   - ContentView.swift
   - CreateRoomView.swift
   - HomeView.swift
   - JoinRoomView.swift
   - LoadingView.swift
   - ParticleBackgroundView.swift
   - RoomInfoView.swift
5. Click "Add"

### 4. Build the Project
Press `Cmd+B` to build the project. It should now build successfully!

### 5. Run the App
Press `Cmd+R` to run the app in the simulator.

## What This Fixes
- Removes broken file references
- Adds the correct SwiftUI files with iOS 15 compatibility
- Enables building and running the native iOS app

## Testing the App
Once running, you should see:
1. **Loading screen** with animated progress bar
2. **Home screen** with floating particles and menu buttons  
3. **Create/Join room** functionality
4. **Real-time chat** with the backend server
5. **Native iOS performance** and design
