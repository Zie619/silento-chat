## 💡 **What You'll See**

## 🔧 **Next Step: Fix Backend Configuration**

Your hosted backend at `https://silento-backend.onrender.com` needs to serve the **React frontend**, not just API responses.

### **Solution Options:**

**Option A: Configure Backend to Serve Frontend**
```javascript
// In your backend server (e.g., Express.js)
app.use(express.static('build')); // Serve React build folder
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build/index.html'));
});
```

**Option B: Use Local Development**
```bash
# Run local dev server for testing
npm run client
# Then rebuild iOS app to connect to local server
```

**Option C: Deploy Frontend Separately**
- Deploy React app to Netlify/Vercel
- Update iOS app to point to frontend URL
- Keep backend for API calls only
