## ðŸš€ **Deploy Now - Simple Steps**

### **Step 1: Commit & Push**
```bash
# Add all changes (run these commands in Terminal)
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix backend to serve React frontend

- Modified server/index.ts to serve static React build in production
- Updated package.json with proper build commands
- Updated render.yaml for production deployment  
- Built React frontend in dist/ folder
- Removed temporary iOS interface
- Backend now serves full Silento app at root URL"

# Push to your silento-chat repo
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Deployment**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Find your **silento-backend** service
3. Watch the deployment progress
4. Wait for **"Deploy live"** status

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**
Once deployed, test these URLs:
- `https://silento-backend.onrender.com` â†’ Should show Silento app (not "get/")
- `https://silento-backend.onrender.com/health` â†’ Should show health check
- `https://silento-backend.onrender.com/api/create-room` â†’ Should work for API

## ðŸ“± **Update iOS App**

After backend deployment completes:

```bash
# Rebuild iOS app to use new backend
cd ios
xcodebuild -project Silento.xcodeproj -scheme Silento -configuration Release clean build

# Install on iPhone via Xcode or command line
```
